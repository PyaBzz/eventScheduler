Intro:

The assignment is open-ended on purpose, as we are interested in seeing how you navigate the trade-offs involved.
There is no specific “correct” solution that we expect.
We expect to get an insight into where/how you may fit into our team by examining the work you submit.

Assignment:

The app should have a list of upcoming and past events and a form for creating a new event.
When a user selects an event on the list, details of the event should appear somewhere.
Create a simple RESTful API server to provide the event data to the app

Expectations:
tools, framework(s), libraries, data storage, etc. is up to you based on what you consider helpful/useful
Include a readme file explaining:
your decisions about why you chose the technology you did
any trade-offs you made or shortcuts you took because of limited time available for the assignment
(you’d normally do something differently but had to focus on other things you deemed more important)
We should be able to run and test your solution locally
Typescript is preferred but not required
 
Reasons for Node + Express:
- Little boilerplate required to make a simple demo
- The assignment suggests TypeScript



Environment Setup:
If you're on an Arch Linux machine you're in luck. Just run setup.sh to take these steps.
Make sure you have node version 16.13.2 + npm version 8.5.4
Run npm install

How to run:
npm start

Further steps:
- EsLint
- Configuration file for other environments
- Add controllers if more functionality needed
- Add middleware for authentication
- Add middleware for logging
